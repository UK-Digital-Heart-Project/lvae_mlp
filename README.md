# Explainable Shape Analysis through Deep Hierarchical Generative Models

The Tensorflow code in this repository implements the modifications of the VAE and Ladder VAE frameworks presented in *[Learning interpretable anatomical features through deep generative models: Application to cardiac remodeling](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.06843.pdf)* and Explainable Shape Analysis through Deep Hierarchical Generative Models: Application to Cardiac Remodelling papers. 

## Acknowledgement
This implementation was inspired by *[geosada](https://github.com/geosada/LVAE)* Tensorflow implementation of the LVAE original paper.
